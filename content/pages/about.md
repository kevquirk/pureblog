Pure Blog is a lightweight, flat-file blogging platform built for speed and simplicity. Posts and pages live as Markdown files, so there’s no database to manage and content is easy to edit, version, or move.

The admin area gives you a clean editor for drafting and publishing posts, managing pages, uploading images, and tuning the site’s theme. It’s designed to stay out of your way while still giving you the controls you need.

## What it does

- **Markdown-first writing** with a distraction-free editor.
- **Posts and pages** with drafts, tags, and rich metadata.
- **Theme controls** for fonts, color modes, post layouts, and custom CSS.
- **Image uploads** with copy‑ready Markdown.
- **RSS feed** for subscribers.
- **Search** for quick access to posts.

## Why flat files?

Flat files keep things portable and reliable. Your content is just text, so backups are simple and deployments are fast. It’s a great fit for personal blogs, documentation, and small sites that don’t need a full CMS.
